# Perkins-Disease-Detection
 Objective: To build a model to accurately detect the prescence of Parkinson's disease in an individual

Pre-Processed data using Normalisation and applied \textbf{Dimentsionality Reduction} using Principal Component Analysis
Evaluated dataset K-Nearest Neighbour with anaccuracy of 89 %, Support Vector Machine with an accuracy of 89 %
Implemented XGBoost Algorithm to obtain an accuracy of 94 % which turned out to be better than previous datasets
